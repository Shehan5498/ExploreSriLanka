            <h2 class="section__header">Sigiriya Rock Fortress</h2>
            <p class="section__subheader">
                Sigiriya, also known as Lion Rock, is an ancient rock fortress located in the Matale District. This
                iconic landmark rises 200 meters above the surrounding plains and is known for its significant
                archaeological and historical value. The fortress was built by King Kashyapa (477-495 AD) and is
                surrounded by gardens, reservoirs, and other structures. The main entrance is situated on the northern
                side of the rock, designed in the form of a gigantic lion. Today, only the lion's paws remain, but they
                give a glimpse into the grandeur of what once stood.<br><br>
            <div class="sectionsubsubheader">
                <Strong>Frescoes :</Strong> One of the highlights of Sigiriya is the series of frescoes found on a
                sheltered rock face
                about halfway up the fortress. These frescoes, known as the Sigiriya maidens, depict female figures in
                various poses and are considered masterpieces of ancient Sri Lankan art.<br><br>

                <Strong>Gardens :</Strong> The approach to Sigiriya is through elaborate water gardens, boulder gardens,
                and terraced
                gardens with pools and fountains. These landscaped gardens showcase ancient hydraulic engineering and
                gardening skills, reflecting the advanced civilization that once thrived here.<br><br>

                <Strong>Mirror Wall :</Strong> As visitors ascend towards the summit, they pass by the Mirror Wall, a
                highly polished wall
                made of brick and plaster. Originally, this wall was so smooth that the king could see his reflection in
                it. Over the centuries, it has been covered with inscriptions and graffiti left by ancient travelers,
                providing a glimpse into the thoughts and emotions of visitors from long ago.<br><br>

                <Strong>Summit :</Strong> At the top of Sigiriya Rock, visitors can explore the remains of the royal
                palace complex,
                including foundations of buildings, cisterns, and pools. The summit offers breathtaking views of the
                surrounding countryside, making the climb a rewarding experience both culturally and visually.
